# Note for the 21st centry

This Git repository is an archive of an old Unix/Linux utility that I preserved
for posterity. It dates back to the early days of the internet and was
originally provided to me during my first tech job. I found it in my personal
archive of tools and wanted to share it with others.  â€” Stefan
